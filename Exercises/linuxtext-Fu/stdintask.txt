Q:Try out a couple of commands:

$ echo < peanuts.txt > banana.txt

$ ls < peanuts.txt > banana.txt

$ pwd < peanuts.txt > banana.txt

Solution;
We redirected the file in peanuts.txt has stdin to echo and redirected it with stdout to banana.txt but the content of peanuts did not read on the banana file

we list out the content in the peanuts.txt file into ls command using stdin and write it to banan.txt file with stdout

same as the first one
